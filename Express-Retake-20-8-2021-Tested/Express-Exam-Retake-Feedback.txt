1. Details Page
<!-- if there are already tenants of the housing, separate their names with a comma and a space ","  -->
<!--<p>People rented this housing: Alex Petkov</p>-->

The example is only one -> the developer cant see how the separator {, } is being used.
Suggestion, Change it to <!--<p>People rented this housing: Alex Petkov, Ivan Dobrev, Pesho Peshov</p>-->

2. Home Page in the .docx file 
"Visualize the 3 last added housing offers, in ascending order." 

In ascending by which field ? Year, Name, City, Available Peaces?
Suggestion eyther give the concrete name of the field or remove the requirement.

3. Rename Notice to Name due to a spelling inaccuracy that causes confusion and thus slows the development process.
